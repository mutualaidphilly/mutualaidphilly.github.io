Our community can support you grocery shopping, prescription pickup, cash, emotional support or truly anything.
We accept requests every Monday at 12pm via online form or phone at 215-798-0222. We can only take a limited number of requests each week. We *alternate weeks* between cash requests, and requests for everything else (groceries, household supplies, prescription pickup etc).

# Donate P-EBT Funds
If you would like to donate the P-EBT funds from the Philadelphia school district to families in need, you have two options:

1. **Donate the monetary equivalent to Mutual Aid Philly.** In this case, you use the card yourself (since the cards are not legally transferable) and donate the monetary equivalent on [Action Network](https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/mutual-aid-philly/) or Venmo (search @mutualaidphl).
2. **Sign up to sponsor a family.** In this case, you’ll sign up by checking the “Donate EBT groceries” option on our form . One of our volunteers will match you with a family that needs groceries, let you know their grocery list, and connect you with the family to schedule a contactless delivery. You will shop and deliver the groceries. If there is a language barrier, our volunteers with act as translators for the process.

The money donated to Mutual Aid Philly is used for both for direct monetary aid (up to $100 per family) and to pay for groceries, prescriptions, and cleaning supplies that we deliver to community members. All donations go to community members in need and we keep a public spreadsheet of transactions on our website for transparency.
